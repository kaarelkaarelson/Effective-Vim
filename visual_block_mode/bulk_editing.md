# Visual Block Mode

## Editing multiple lines

Edit vertically aligned text: `V` -> then select desired lines with `hjkl` -> go into insert mode `I` (good for inserting spaces and tabs for identation)

Add text to vertically aligned code: Enter Visual Block Mode and select desired lines -> go into insert mode `I` -> type the text that you want to insert on the initial line -> `press <Esc>` (... and boom, all your lines are edited).

Replace vertically aligned text:  Enter Visual Block Mode and select desired lines and text -> press `c` -> type the text that you want to insert on the initial line -> `press <Esc>` (all the selected lines will update as well).
